# What is Text Mining?
Text mining, also known as text analysis, is the process of transforming unstructured text into meaningful and actionable information. By identifying topics, patterns, and relevant keywords, text mining allows you to obtain valuable insights without needing to go through all your data manually.

Thanks to text mining, businesses are being able to analyze complex and large sets of data in a simple, fast and effective way. At the same time, companies are taking advantage of this powerful tool to reduce some of their manual and repetitive tasks, saving their teams precious time and allowing customer support agents to focus on what they do best.

Let’s say you need to examine tons of reviews in G2 Crowd to understand what customers are praising or criticizing about your SaaS. A text mining algorithm could help you identify the most popular topics that arise in customer comments, and the way that people feel about them: are the comments positive, negative or neutral? You could also find out the main keywords mentioned by customers regarding a given topic.

In a nutshell, text mining helps companies make the most of their data, which leads to better data-driven business decisions.

At this point you may already be wondering, how does text mining accomplish all of this? The answer takes us directly to the concept of machine learning.

Machine learning is a discipline derived from AI, which focuses on creating algorithms that enable computers to learn tasks based on examples. Machine learning models need to be trained with data, after which they’re able to predict with a certain level of accuracy automatically.

When text mining and machine learning are combined, automated text analysis becomes possible.

Going back to our previous example of SaaS reviews, let’s say you want to classify those reviews into different topics like UI/UX, Bugs, Pricing or Customer Support. The first thing you’d do is train a topic classifier model, by uploading a set of examples and tagging them manually. After being fed several examples, the model will learn to differentiate topics and start making associations as well as its own predictions. To obtain good levels of accuracy, you should feed your models a large number of examples that are representative of the problem you’re trying to solve.

Now that you’ve learned what text mining is, we’ll see how it differentiates from other usual terms, like text analysis and text analytics.

Difference between Text Mining, Text Analysis, and Text Analytics?
Text mining and text analysis are often used as synonyms. Text analytics, however, is a slightly different concept.

# So, what’s the difference between text mining and text analytics?

In short, they both intend to solve the same problem (automatically analyzing raw text data) by using different techniques. Text mining identifies relevant information within a text and therefore, provides qualitative results. Text analytics, however, focuses on finding patterns and trends across large sets of data, resulting in more quantitative results. Text analytics is usually used to create graphs, tables and other sorts of visual reports.

Text mining combines notions of statistics, linguistics, and machine learning to create models that learn from training data and can predict results on new information based on their previous experience.

Text analytics, on the other hand, uses results from analyses performed by text mining models, to create graphs and all kinds of data visualizations.

Choosing the right approach depends on what type of information is available. In most cases, both approaches are combined for each analysis, leading to more compelling results.
